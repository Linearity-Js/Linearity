  <b>Row</b> ops on <b>A|b</b> amount to interchanging two equations or multiplying an equation by
  a <b>nonzero</b> constant or adding a multiple of one equation to another. They do <b>not</b>
  change the solution so they may be used to <b>simplify</b> the system. In particular,
  performing row ops on <b>A|b</b> until <b>A</b> is in echelon form is called <b>Gaussian elimination</b>.
