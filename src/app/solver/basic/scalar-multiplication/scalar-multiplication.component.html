    Matrix Scalar Multipliction
  </h4>
<p>
  Let <b>A</b> = [ a<sub> i j </sub>] be <i>m x n</i> matrix and <i>c</i> a scalar.
  Then the scalar product of the scalar <i>c</i> with the matrix <b>A</b>, denoted by <i>c<b>A</b></i>, is defined by the formula
</p>
<p>
  <i>c<b>A</b></i> = [ ca<sub> i j </sub>].
